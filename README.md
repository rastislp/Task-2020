Task 1 - SQRT2 **completed**
Calculation square root of 2. Result will be printed with 100 decimal places and calculation completed without any in-build library. 

Task 2 - Dicerolls¶ **completed**
Python function called dicerolls that simulates rolling dice. Your function should take two parameters: the number of dice k and the number of times to roll the dice n. The function should simulate randomly rolling k dice n times, keeping track of each total face value. It should then return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred.

Task 3 - Binomial distribution¶ **completed**
The numpy.random.binomial function can be used to simulate flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails. Interestingly, if a coin is flipped many times then the number of heads is well approximated by a bell-shaped curve. For instance, if we flip a coin 100 times in a row the chance of getting 50 heads is relatively high, the chances of getting 0 or 100 heads is relatively low, and the chances of getting any other number of heads decreases as you move away from 50 in either direction towards 0 or 100.

Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve.
